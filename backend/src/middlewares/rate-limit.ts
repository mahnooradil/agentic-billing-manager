/**
 * In-memory per-user rate limiter (UI-Agent.4).
 *
 * Protects abuse-prone actions (connection attempts, verification, reconnect,
 * connect-token minting, chat) with a fixed-window counter keyed by the
 * authenticated user (falling back to IP for unauthenticated paths). Returns a
 * clean 429 `AppError` on breach — never a raw error.
 *
 * NOTE: single-process/in-memory by design (no new dependency). For a multi-
 * instance deployment this should move to a shared store (Redis) — tracked in
 * PRODUCTION-HARDENING. Mount AFTER `authenticate` so `req.user` is set.
