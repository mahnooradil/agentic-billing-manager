 * this module's own mapping below — config/plans.ts itself carries no
 * credits field and knows nothing about this file, so the two systems can
 * change independently. No payment processor is wired up yet; this is the
 * free-tier token-metering system a future Stripe-backed purchase flow will
 * plug into (the ledger already supports a "purchase" grant type — see
 * services/credits/credit-ledger.service.ts's `grantCredits` — for exactly
 * that, once real "Buy more credits" checkout exists).

/**
 * Credits an account is reset to at the START of each plan-cycle (see
 * services/credits/credit-reset-scheduler.ts) — sized so that even if a
 * plan's ENTIRE allowance is used in one cycle, the real Anthropic cost
 * stays safely below what that cycle's subscription revenue covers:
 *
 *   Free:     100 credits/mo → worst case $2/mo  — plan price $0/mo  (bounded acquisition cost)
 *   Pro:      333 credits/mo → worst case $6.7/mo — plan price $15/mo — ~55% margin even at full use
 *   Business: 1000 credits/mo → worst case $20/mo — plan price $49/mo — ~59% margin even at full use
 *
 * Typical real usage (see the usage estimate this was derived from) is far
 * below these numbers — a normal user never gets near the ceiling; it only
 * bites someone who is genuinely using the AI features far beyond typical
 * patterns.
 *
 * Every plan now resets MONTHLY (see `CREDIT_CYCLE_DAYS_BY_PLAN`) — Pro and
 * Business used to get one lump allowance for a full 365-day cycle (4000 /
 * 12000 credits respectively). The audit (CLAUDE.md §10.3/§10.4,
 * docs/audit/03-COST-AND-UNIT-ECONOMICS.md §6, CR-012) flagged this as a
 * real bug: a paid subscription bills monthly, but its AI allowance only
 * renewed once a year, so a customer who exhausted their credits early
 * (e.g. the email-sync re-extraction bug, since fixed — see
 * services/email-sync's ProcessedMessage dedup) was left with a dead
 * product for up to 11.5 months with no way to buy more credits at the
 * time. The fix here is NOT "give them the same 4000/12000 every month" —
 * that would blow the margin math above 12×. It's the exact same annual
 * total, divided into 12 monthly installments, so a customer regains a
 * fair-use ceiling every 30 days instead of once a year, at the identical
 * overall cost ratio already decided above.
 *
 * Once exhausted mid-cycle, the account simply waits for the next cycle
 * reset (now at most 30 days away for every tier, not 365), or buys more
 * credits separately via the "Buy more credits" Stripe checkout flow
 * (config/credit-packages.ts) — there is no automatic top-up.
