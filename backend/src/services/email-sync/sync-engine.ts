/**
 * Email-sync engine — scans ONE connected inbox (Gmail or Outlook) for
 * invoice-like messages and upserts parsed fields into the Billing
 * collection with `source: "email_sync"`. A fallback channel behind
 * services/billing-sync: only runs for platforms with no billing-sync
 * adapter coverage (see registry.ts). Idempotent and best-effort, mirroring
 * services/billing-sync/sync-engine.ts's safety guarantees — never throws,
 * one bad message never aborts the run.
 *
 * Provider-agnostic: everything specific to Gmail vs Outlook (search-query
 * syntax, raw API shape, message normalization) lives behind provider.ts's
 * EmailSyncProvider; this file only knows the loop (pagination, safety cap,
 * watermark, dedupe/upsert) plus the AI extraction step every candidate
 * message goes through.
 *
 * Called from two places: right after an email-sync connection is created
 * (one immediate pull) and by the recurring scheduler (scheduler.ts).
